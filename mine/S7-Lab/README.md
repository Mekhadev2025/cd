# S7-Lab
# KTU S7 CD Lab Repository
### CSL 411 COMPILER LAB  

This repository contains the solutions for the **Compiler Design (CD) Lab** assignments for the 7th Semester, as per the **KTU S7 syllabus**. The tasks are divided into four cycles, and the repository will be updated according to the completion deadlines for each cycle.

## Cycle I: Lexical Analyzer and Automata 
1. **Lexical Analyzer**: Design and implement a lexical analyzer for a given language using C. The lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. **ε-Closure**: Write a program to find the ε-closure of all states of any given NFA with ε-transitions.
3. **NFA to NFA without ε-Transitions**: Write a program to convert an NFA with ε-transitions to an NFA without ε-transitions.
4. **NFA to DFA**: Write a program to convert an NFA to a DFA.
5. **DFA Minimization**: Write a program to minimize a given DFA.

## Cycle II: Lex and YACC Programs 
1. **Lex Program for Name Substring Check**: Write a Lex program to recognize all strings that do not contain the first four characters of your name as a substring.
2. **YACC Program for Valid Variables**: Write a YACC program to recognize a valid variable that starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.
3. **Calculator using Lex and YACC**: Implement a calculator using Lex and YACC.
4. **BNF to YACC with Abstract Syntax Tree**: Convert the BNF rules into YACC form and write code to generate an abstract syntax tree.
5. **YACC Program for C FOR Statement Syntax Check**: Write a YACC program to check the syntax of the FOR statement in C.

## Cycle III: Parsing Techniques 
1. **Operator Precedence Parser**: Develop an operator precedence parser for a given language.
2. **First and Follow Simulation**: Write a program to simulate First and Follow of any given grammar.
3. **Recursive Descent Parser**: Construct a recursive descent parser for an expression.
4. **Shift Reduce Parser**: Construct a Shift Reduce Parser for a given language.

---

## Cycle IV: Intermediate Code Generation and Back-end Implementation 
1. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Implement intermediate code generation for simple expressions.
2. **Back-end of Compiler**: Implement the back end of the compiler that takes the three-address code and produces 8086 assembly language instructions. The target assembly instructions can include simple operations like move, add, sub, jump, etc.
