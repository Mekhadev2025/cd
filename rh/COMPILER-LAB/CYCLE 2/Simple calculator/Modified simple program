Workings of YACC
YACC in compiler design is set to work in C programming language along with its parser generator.

An input with a .y extension is given.
The file is invoked, and 2 files, y.tab.h and y.tab.c, are created. These files contain long codes implementing the LARl (1) Parser for grammar.
This file then provides yyparse.y, which tries to parse a valid sentence successfully.
For the output files, 

If called with the –d option in the command line, YACC produces y.tab.h with all its specific definitions.
If called with the –v option, YACC produces y.output having a textual description of the LALR(1) parsing table.
